<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> A collection of facts is called a data. Such as, numbers, words, observations and description of things. Additionally, data can be classified into two types: Quantitative and Qualitative</li>
<li><strong>Entity:</strong> Real world objects are called Entities. It can be identified very easily. It can be an individual living or non-living thing.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute:</strong> Properties of an entity is known as attributes. It describes an entity thoroughly.</li>
<li><strong>Data-type:</strong> Attributes, which is also known as domain, are rules that describe the legal values of a field type. They are used to constrain the values allowed in particular attribute for a table.</li>
<li><strong>Information:</strong> Information is a group of data processed in a meaningful way. It is well-structured.</li>
<li><strong>Database:</strong> Organized collection of coherent and meaningful data (structured information) recorded or stored electronically in a computer system is called Database.</li>
<li><strong>DBMS:</strong> Set of programs designed to create and maintain (by means of CRUD Operations) a Database Management System.</li>
<li><strong>RDBMS:</strong> A DBMS which is based on relational model and stores data in a form of relations (or to be said table-structure) is known as relational database management system.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Key:</strong> A key through which we can uniquely identifies a row in each table is known as a Primary Key (PK, for short). A single table can consist Primary Key made of using one or more attributes or columns.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Key:</strong> A key borrowed from another related table in order to make the relationship between two tables is called Foreign Key (abbreviated as FK). FK must match actual values and data types with the related PK.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>RDBMS:</strong> Relational Database Management System</li>
<li><strong>SQL:</strong> Structured Query Language</li>

<h4 id="difference-between-dbms--rdbms.">4. Difference between DBMS &amp; RDBMS.</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In DBMS, data are stored in a file format. Meanwhile, Tables are used to store in RDBMS.</li>
<li>In DBMS, data are usually stored in a hierarchical arrangement and it deals with small amount of data. In RDBMS, data are stored in a table format where data can be extracted easily, hence, it can deal with large quantity of data.</li>
<li>DBMS supports single user at a time. In contrast to it, RDBMS allows multiple users to access database simultaneously.</li>
<li>RDBMS supports distributed databases, unlike DBMS.</li>
<li>Data can be normalized in RDBMS, but not in DBMS.</li>
</ul>

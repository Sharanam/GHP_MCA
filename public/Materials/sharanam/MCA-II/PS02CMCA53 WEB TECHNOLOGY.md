- Web is about content (the pages we see when we are online) whereas internet is a service, network of networks.
- Terms:
  - indexing: numbering the content to retrieve it faster
  - ranking: appearance of link on the search page
- Searches
  1. Natural / Organic Search
     - Indexing based on keywords
     - Prioritized based on number of hits
  2. Paid Search
     - PPC (Pay per Click)
- Motive of this subject (Web Technology) is
   - to make web based application rather than a desktop application, where users need not to install it natively and can work using any device.
- Difference between web design and web development
   - Web designer will work on layout planning, templates using GUI based tools. They design a thing that client will look at.
   - Web developer (programmers) creates applications using programming languages.
- PHP:
   1. Open Source
      - It is freeware.
      - Open source programs (such as linux, php, python, etc.) are mainly licensed under GPL (GNU's General Public License) as it is the one of the most popular open source licenses. Users (Consumers) won't need to get or renew license for these products.
   2. Server Side
      - e.g., Page made with HTML, JS and PHP will only send HTML & JS to the client.
   3. HTML embedded scripting language
      - We cannot use php for designing web page.
      (We can't provide UI using pure PHP, e.g., taking input from the user without HTML...)
- Throughout the course, we will
   - use MySQL for data-level-management
   - incorporate JS with PHP
- PHP is
   - compatible with various OS, Editors, Servers (Apache, IIS, etc.)
   - easy to use/ migrate to
- extensions of PHP files:
   - .php
   - .php3
   - .phtml
- Performance of PHP:
   - can be shown on the facebook page (which is made using php)
   - and can be compared with websites (like ojas - online job application) made with ASP.NET (it usually crashes even with less traffic)
- For exam's view, we need to be ready with:
   1. Syntax
   2. Use (Functionality) (in meaning or theory)
   3. Examples

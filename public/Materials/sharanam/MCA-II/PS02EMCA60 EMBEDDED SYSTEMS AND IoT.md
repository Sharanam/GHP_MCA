    - What is an embedded computer?
        - An embedded computer is frequently a computer that is implemented for a particular purpose. Usually, they have a single task or a very small number of related tasks that they are programmed to perform. They rarely have generic interface.
 - Applications of embedded systems and IoT
   - Bus, Car, Aircraft, Washing Machine, etc.
